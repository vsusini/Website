                                In my role, I lead the front-end development of production applications for Sales Engineers using Angular, TypeScript, and Material UI components.

                                My time at Telesat was brief but I was able to learn several new skills. 
                                I was brought onto the Systems Operations team to develop tools to support the business needs of the Sales and Solutions team. 
                                I also experienced a full agile process for the creation of a full-stack tool. 
                                During the term, I got to develop the tools in Typescript, Javascript, HTML, Bootstrap (CSS), and React. 
                                While developing, I was reintroduced to design patterns and was exposed to containerization and container development to communicate with the software architect effectively.  
                                Overall, I was able to pick up some new skills and knowledge that will continue to advance my career.

                                2Keys was an outstanding start to my first software developer position. I began working with the macOS for the first time and quickly adapted to the environment.
                                I was challenged with the task of updating a previous version of software 2Keys offered to clients. Aside from new features, I got to completely update the UX and UI. 
                                I worked with the team early on to design wire-frames and to complete a functional design of the project before starting development. 
                                This allowed myself to plan out a portion of the development tasks and to help manage my time accordingly. I was introduced to the Spring Boot framework, J2EE programming, and MongoDB to complete new features for the application. 
                                To support the front-end development and the new UI that was introduced, I used my Javascript, HTML, and CSS experience to implement the new designs while also learning my first CSS component library, Bootstrap.

                                I also had the opportunity to apply my C++ and C skills to develop a resource manager in QNX for one of the devices my team focused on. 
                                Throughout the entire term, I learned the building blocks to successfully developing in the Linux OS, used and applied knowledge from C++ and C such as maximizing the potential of pointers, and I also learned to properly comment and test code to help other developers better understand the purpose of it.
                                Aside from learning valuable skills to develop in an embedded systems environment, I also learned valuable skills at Ford that has helped to improve my development in any environment while I continue to improve as a developer.

                                Javascript was involved in several projects I worked on while at the company and I was able to gain quite the intermediate understanding of the language and what can be done with it. 
                                I was introduced to Sharepoint as well and used both Javascript, CSS, and HTML to develop and support the intranet the company was creating for internal use. 
                                I also experienced Quality Assurance in the position. Using automated testing frameworks, I tested features within ServiceNow that the company used.

                                semi-supervised clustering. Using previously learned skills, I was able to create an application using React, Node.js, and Python to improve semi-supervised clustering 
                                by generating vital questions to improve a clustering result and simplifying the process of generating and utilizing annotated data as it is inputted by the user. Utilizing machine learning 
                                and metrics, an algorithm was created to help determine samples in a dataset with a poor probability of being classified correctly. The user would then be queried the samples to improve the clustering result.

                                I got the opportunity to take a Computer Graphics course during my fourth year. Near the end of the semester, I got to choose a final project to complete.
                                The class had briefly discussed Perlin Noise but I wanted to learn more about noise, how it was generated, and what it could be used for.
                                I started with some dots using Three JS where the height of the dots was based on a Perlin noise function. I soon realized it looked very similar to some type of 
                                terrain generator and decided to add in the ability to change colours for different values of the Perlin function. Overall, I achieved 100% on the project and
                                had learned a fair amount for future projects and how I could apply Perlin's noise in the future.

                                I often found myself getting bored while playing drinking games with friends. 
                                I found that some games had too little activities and others were just plain dumb.
                                With a friend of mine, we set out to create our own drinking game as we both wanted a project to work on that involved Javascript.
                                After several iterations, multiple wireframes, and different character lists, we decided on letting the drinks be the characters.
                                The project is still a work in progress as we continue to add more features and address bugs.

                                Ottawa was an amazing experience for me. It got me out of my comfort zone as I moved to live not only by myself, but also 
                                upto four hours away from the home I had previously lived in. 
                                I met amazing professors who inspired me to do projects like this
                                and also encouraged me to continue to learn in different facets of Computer Science and Software Engineering. I was also in a position to develop relationships with
                                many talented individuals with similar minds as myself as they continue to motivate me to develop projects that emerge during my career.
